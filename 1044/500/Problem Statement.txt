Problem Statement

Cat Snuke has learned that the number of ways to choose three things from x identical things is x(x-1)(x-2)/6. It means that the polynomial x(x-1)(x-2) is divisible by 6 for any integer x. He defined the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a nonzero polynomial P as the maximal integer d such that P(x) is always divisible by d for any integer x. For example, the GCD of P(x) = x(x-1)(x-2) is 6, because P(x) is always divisible by 6 and no bigger integer divides all P(x).  You want to compute the GCD of a polynomial P that is given as a product of many linear terms. You are given a string s that describes P. Construct P as follows: Start with P(x)=1 for all x. For each valid i, the character s[i] will be between '0' and '9', inclusive. Interpret it as a digit d[i] between 0 and 9, inclusive. Multiply P by the term (x-i)^d[i].  Compute the GCD of the polynomial P, and return it modulo 1,000,000,007.
