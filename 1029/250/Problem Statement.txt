Problem Statement

You had a non-empty string s but you lost it. Cat Snuke found the string and removed one character from the string. Later, Snuke gave you the string t. Can this be the string created from your string s?  You are given the strings s and t. Return "Possible" (quotes for clarity) if t can be obtained from s by erasing exactly one character. Otherwise, return "Impossible". Note that the return value is case-sensitive.
