Problem Statement

John and Brus have some integers. You are given these integers in a tuple (integer) numbers. In one operation they can pick a number and increase/decrease it by 1. They want to have at least k consecutive integers. The order in which those integers appear in numbers does not matter. Return the minimal number of operations required to achieve the goal.

Examples
0)


{4, 7, 47}
2
Returns: 2
There are three optimal strategies:
Increase 4 two times to obtain {6,7,47}.
Decrease 7 two times to obtain {4,5,47}.
Increase 4 and decrease 7 to obtain {5,6,47}.
1)


{1, 100}
1
Returns: 0
No operation is needed.
2)


{-96, -53, 82, -24, 6, -75}
2
Returns: 20

3)


{64, -31, -56}
2
Returns: 24

4)


{-96, -53, 82, -24, 6, -75}
4
Returns: 90
