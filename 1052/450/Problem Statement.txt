Problem Statement

Bob is going to create a graph with N nodes. The graph will be constructed in two steps. First, Bob will take N isolated vertices, label them 1 through N and color each of them using one of K colors. Then, Bob will add some directed edges to the graph. For each i between 2 and N, inclusive, Bob may choose a single value j < i such that the nodes i and j have different colors. If he does, he will add the edge from i to j to his graph. Note that Bob may choose not to add any edge from node i, even if there are some valid choices of j.
Two graphs are considered the same if they have the same node colors and the same set of edges.
You are given the long integers N and K. You are also given an integer M. Compute and return the number of different graphs Bob may construct, modulo M.
