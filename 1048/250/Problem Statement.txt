Problem Statement

Garth likes apples and oranges. Recently he bought N fruits, where each fruit was either an apple or an orange. Then he ate all N fruits in some order. You are given an integer K. Garth observed that at every point in time, if he made a list of the last K fruits he ate, there were at most K/2 (rounded down) apples in this list.  For each valid i, you know that the info[i]-th fruit Garth ate was an apple. (Fruits Garth ate are numbered starting from 1. For example, info[i]=1 means that the very first fruit Garth ate was an apple.)  Please find and return the maximum number of apples Garth could have eaten.

Class:
ApplesAndOrangesEasy
Method:
maximumApples
Parameters:
integer, integer, tuple (integer)
Returns:
integer
Method signature:
def maximumApples(self, N, K, info):

Limits

Time limit (s):
2.000
Memory limit (MB):
256
Stack limit (MB):
256
Notes
-
If Garth makes his list at a point in time when he ate fewer than K fruits, his list will have fewer than K fruits but the requirement will still be the same: there have to be at most K/2 apples in the list.
Constraints
-
N will be between 2 and 2,000, inclusive.
-
K will be between 2 and N, inclusive.
-
info will contain between 0 and N elements, inclusive.
-
Each element of info will be between 1 and N, inclusive.
-
The elements of info will be distinct.
-
The elements of info will be consistent with Garth's observation.

Returns: 2
Garth ate N=3 fruites. The requirement is that any K=2 consecutive fruits may contain at most K/2 = 1 apple. As info is empty, you have no additional information about the fruits Garth ate.  Garth might have eaten an apple, then an orange, then an apple. This satisfies the conditions:
After eating the 1st fruit, the list is [apple].
After eating the 2nd fruit, the list is [apple, orange].
After eating the 3rd fruit, the list is [orange, apple].
Each list contains at most 1 apple.
