Problem Statement

The King of Byteland likes integer factorization. Your task is to help him factor the number N. You will be given the long integer N and you should return a tuple (long integer) containing all prime factors of N sorted in non-decreasing order. Note that some primes may occur multiple times in the prime factorization of N. For example, for N = 60 the only correct return value is {2, 2, 3, 5} because 2*2*3*5 = 60.

To make this task easier, the King has decided to give you a hint. He already knows the correct factorization and he will tell you every second number in the correct return value. More precisely, in addition to N you will be given a tuple (long integer) primes. The number of elements in primes will be (M+1)/2, rounded down, where M is the number of elements in the correct return value. For each valid i, primes[i] will be equal to the element 2i of the correct return value. (All indices are 0-based.)

Given N and primes, return the tuple (long integer) containing the factorization of N.
