Problem Statement

Cat Taro likes strings. You are given a String S. Each character of S is 'A', 'B', or '?'.

To Taro, the ugliness of a string is the number of pairs of equal consecutive characters. For example, the ugliness of "ABABAABBB" is 3: there is one pair "AA" and two (overlapping) pairs "BB".

Taro now wants to change each question mark in S either to 'A' or to 'B'. His goal is to minimize the ugliness of the resulting string. Return the smallest ugliness that can be achieved.
