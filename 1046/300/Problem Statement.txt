Problem Statement

In a tree, the distance between two nodes is the number of edges on the (only) simple path that connects them.  You are given a tuple (string) x with N elements, each containing N characters. Draw a tree with N nodes, numbered 0 through N-1. The tree must have the following properties: For each i and j, if x[i][j] is 'E' the distance between i and j must be even, and if it is 'O' (uppercase o) this distance must be odd.  If there is no tree with these properties, return {-1}. Otherwise, return a tuple (integer) with 2N-2 elements: the list of edges in one such tree. For example, if N=3 and your tree contains the edges 0-2 and 1-2, return {0,2,1,2}. If there are multiple correct outputs you may output any of them.

Notes
-
If you use plugins to test your solution, be careful. Plugins cannot tell you whether your solution is correct -- they'll just tell you whether it matches the example output exactly.
Constraints
-
n will be between 2 and 50, inclusive.
-
x will contain exactly n elements.
-
Each element in x will have exactly n characters.
-
Each character in x will be 'O' or 'E'.
Examples
0)


{"EOE",
 "OEO",
 "EOE"}
Returns: {0, 1, 2, 1 }
The tree: 0-1-2 is a valid answer.
1)


{"EO",
 "OE"}
Returns: {0, 1 }

2)


{"OO",
 "OE"}
Returns: {-1 }
dist[0][0] must be 0, and it should be an even number, so it is impossible.
3)


{"EO",
 "EE"}
Returns: {-1 }
dist[0][1] should be same with dist[1][0].
4)


{"EOEO",
 "OEOE",
 "EOEO",
 "OEOE"}
Returns: {0, 1, 0, 3, 2, 1 }
