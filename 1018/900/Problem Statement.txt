Problem Statement

We are looking for a square matrix with some special properties:
The matrix has n rows (and therefore n columns).
Each entry in the matrix is either 0 or 1.
Some of the 1s are given in advance.
The square of the matrix must be the zero matrix (i.e., the matrix in which all entries are zeros). See Notes for a formal definition.
You are given the integer n. Rows of the matrix are numbered 1 through n. Columns of the matrix are also numbered 1 through n.
You are also given two tuple (integer)s: r and c. For each valid i, the entry in row r[i] and column c[i] is a 1.
Compute and return the number of matrices that have the given properties, modulo 1,000,000,007.
Definition

Class:
SquareOfSquareMatrix
Method:
count
Parameters:
integer, tuple (integer), tuple (integer)
Returns:
integer
Method signature:
def count(self, n, r, c):

Limits

Time limit (s):
2.000
Memory limit (MB):
256
Stack limit (MB):
256
Notes
-
Given two n times n matrices B and C with rows and columns numbered as in the problem statement, their product B*C is the n times n matrix P such that for each i and j, P[i][j] is the sum of B[i][k]*C[k][j] over all k from 1 to n.
-
The square of a square matrix A is the matrix A*A.
Constraints
-
n will be between 1 and 500, inclusive.
-
The number of elements in r will be between 0 and 500, inclusive.
-
The number of elements in c will be the same as the number of elements in r.
-
All elements in r and c will be between 1 and n, inclusive.
-
All ordered pairs (r[i], c[i]) will be distinct.

Returns: 3
We do not know anything about the matrix, except for its dimension. There are three matrices that have the desired properties: {{0,0},{0,0}}; {{0,1},{0,0}}; and {{0,0},{1,0}}.

Returns: 0
There is no valid matrix. The square of any matrix that matches the input must have a positive value in row 1 column 1, so it cannot be the zero matrix.
