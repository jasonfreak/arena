Problem Statement

Alice and Bob are playing a game called "The Permutation Game". The game is parameterized with the integer N. At the start of the game, Alice chooses a positive integer x, and Bob chooses a permutation of the first N positive integers. Let p be Bob's permutation. Alice will start at 1, and apply the permutation to this value x times. More formally, let f(1) = p[1], and f(m) = p[f(m-1)] for all m >= 2. Alice's final value will be f(x). Alice wants to choose the smallest x such that f(x) = 1 for any permutation Bob can provide. Compute and return the value of such x modulo 1,000,000,007.

Limits

Time limit (s):
2.000
Memory limit (MB):
256
Stack limit (MB):

Notes
-
A permutation of the first N positive integers is a sequence of length N that contains each of the integers 1 through N exactly once. The i-th (1-indexed) element of a permutation p is denoted by p[i].
Constraints
-
N will be between 1 and 100,000 inclusive.

Returns: 2
Bob can choose the permutations (1,2) or (2,1). If Alice chooses 1, then, Bob can choose the permutation (2,1), which would would make f(1) = 2. However, if Alice chooses 2, no matter which permutation Bob chooses, Alice will get f(2) = 1. Thus the answer in this case is 2.
