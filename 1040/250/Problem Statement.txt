Problem Statement

We have a square board divided into a grid of unit square cells. Initially each cell is white. You are given a tuple (string) board that describes the desired final state. In the final state each cell is either white ('W') or black ('B').  You are also given an integer k. The only change you can make to the board looks as follows: You may select any square of k by k cells and repaint all of them using the same color: either black or white. Later changes to the board may overlap previous ones.  Return "Possible" if we can obtain the desired final state. Otherwise, return "Impossible".

{"BBBW",
 "BWWW",
 "BWWW",
 "WWWW"}
3
Returns: "Possible"
We can reach the desired state by doing two changes. First we paint the 3x3 square in the top left corner black:
BBBW
BBBW
BBBW
WWWW
Then we paint the 3x3 square in the bottom right corner white.
